# Emby Xtream Plugin — Development Notes

## Emby Plugin Architecture

### Emby scans and directly instantiates public service classes via SimpleInjector

**Critical**: Emby's `ApplicationHost.CreateInstanceSafe` scans the plugin assembly and auto-registers ALL public classes that have a constructor matching known DI types (e.g. `ILogger`). It then instantiates these directly via SimpleInjector — **before** the `Plugin` constructor runs.

This means:
- `Plugin.Instance` is **null** when Emby creates these service classes
- `Plugin.Instance.Configuration` will throw (via SimpleInjector wrapping as `ActivationException`)
- **Never call `Plugin.Instance.*` in a service class constructor** (e.g. `StrmSyncService`, `LiveTvService`, `TmdbLookupService`)

**Safe pattern**: Access `Plugin.Instance.Configuration` only from methods called at runtime (not construction time). The `Plugin` constructor calls `new ServiceClass(logger)` itself, but Emby may also create the service independently beforehand.

### Plugin.Instance is set early but Configuration loading requires ApplicationPaths

`BasePlugin<T>.get_Configuration()` calls `Path.Combine(ApplicationPaths.PluginConfigurationsPath, ...)` internally. This path may not be fully initialized when Emby is scanning services, causing `ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'path2')`.

### Delta sync timestamps survive restarts via PluginConfiguration

`PluginConfiguration` is serialized to XML by Emby automatically. Fields added to it persist across restarts without any extra work. Use this for: sync watermarks (`LastMovieSyncTimestamp`, `LastSeriesSyncTimestamp`), channel hashes (`LastChannelListHash`), and similar state.

### Guide grid empty — check browser localStorage

If the Emby guide grid shows no channels despite having channel data, check browser localStorage for a stale `guide-tagids` filter. The guide calls `/LiveTv/EPG?TagIds=<id>` and if the stored tag ID doesn't match any channel, the grid is empty. Fix: click the filter icon in the guide or run `localStorage.removeItem('guide-tagids')` in the browser console.

### SupportsGuideData controls whether Emby polls the tuner for EPG

When `SupportsGuideData()` returns `true`, Emby calls `GetProgramsInternal` on the tuner host for each channel. The `tunerChannelId` parameter is whatever was set in `ChannelInfo.TunerChannelId` — the Gracenote station ID (e.g. `"51529"`) when Dispatcharr is enabled and a station ID exists for the channel, or the raw stream ID (e.g. `"12345"`) otherwise. Use `_tunerChannelIdToStreamId` to translate either form back to a stream ID.

### Emby probes MediaSource.Path directly — disable for Dispatcharr

When `SupportsProbing = true` and `AnalyzeDurationMs > 0`, Emby runs ffprobe against `MediaSource.Path` **independently** of `GetChannelStream` / `ILiveStream`. For Dispatcharr proxy URLs this is destructive: the probe opens a short-lived HTTP connection (~0.1s, ~120KB), then closes it. Dispatcharr interprets the close as the last client leaving and tears down the channel. The real playback connection that follows immediately hits the teardown "channel stop signal" and fails — triggering a rapid retry storm visible in Dispatcharr logs as repeated `Fetchin channel with ID: <n>` → broken pipe cycles.

**Rule**: Always set `SupportsProbing = false` and `AnalyzeDurationMs = 0` for Dispatcharr proxy URLs (`/proxy/ts/stream/{uuid}`), regardless of whether stream stats are available. Direct Xtream URLs (no Dispatcharr) can still use probing when stats are absent.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Significant decisions are recorded in `docs/decisions/NNN-title.md`. Create a new ADR when:
- Choosing between multiple viable approaches (especially after trying alternatives that failed)
- Making a change driven by a non-obvious root cause
- Reversing or replacing a previous approach

Format: see `docs/decisions/001-bypass-dispatcharr-proxy.md` as the template. Each ADR should include Context, Problem, Alternatives considered, Decision, and Consequences.

Numbering: sequential, zero-padded to 3 digits (`001`, `002`, ...).

## Git Workflow

### Never create a GitHub release without explicit user approval

Tag the commit and push the tag, then stop and ask: "Ready to create the GitHub release for vX.Y.Z — shall I proceed?" Do not run `gh release create` until the user says yes.

### Commit before switching context

Never leave changes in the working tree when starting unrelated work or ending a session. An uncommitted change is invisible and easy to tangle with later work. Use a `WIP:` commit or `git stash` if the change isn't ready.

### One concern per branch

Unrelated fixes should live on separate short-lived branches (e.g. `fix/audio-codec-passthrough`, `fix/dispatcharr-probe-storm`) and be merged to `main` independently. This makes each change revertable without touching unrelated code.

### Check `git status` at the start of every session

The git status shown at conversation start reflects the state of the working tree. A modified file there means something is already in flight — address it before starting new work.

### Release notes must credit bug reporters

When editing or creating GitHub release notes, each bug fix entry should include the reporter in brackets:

```
- Fix Dispatcharr reconnect storm by disabling stream probing (reported by scottrobertson)
```

Use the reporter name from `BUGS.md`. If a bug has multiple reporters, list all of them. Internal/self-discovered fixes need no reporter credit. Auto-generated release notes from GitHub never include this — always edit them manually after tagging.

### Release notes must be written for users, not developers

Release notes are read by non-technical users deciding whether to update. Write them from the user's perspective:

- **Lead with what the user experiences**, not what changed in the code. "Channels were failing to play" beats "UUID lookup key was incorrect".
- **Explain the symptom, then the cause, then the fix** — in that order. Users need to recognise their own problem before they care about the solution.
- **Bug fixes**: describe what the user saw (the error message or behaviour), why it happened in plain terms, and what is now different. Credit the reporter at the end of the section.
- **New features**: describe what the user can now do and where to find it. Include the config path if there's a UI setting involved (e.g. *Plugin Config → Settings → STRM Sync Settings*).
- **Avoid commit-log language**: phrases like `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, or "add X via Y" belong in git history, not release notes.
- Use a `## Bug Fix` or `## What's New` top-level heading, then a `### Short symptom-focused title` subheading per item.

**Example — bad:**
```
- feat: fix Dispatcharr UUID mapping for URL-based stream sources
```

**Example — good:**
```
### "Dispatcharr Proxy Unavailable" for Some Channels (reported by Joe 🇺🇸)

Some channels were failing to play with a *Dispatcharr proxy unavailable* error even
though Dispatcharr itself was running fine and other channels worked normally. ...
